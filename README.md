# rshell
CS100 Project, Assignment 2

Introduction: 
In this assignment we will emulate a shell terminal and call it rshell. When rshell is executed it will accept arguments from the user and execute the argumentâ€™s command(s). In order organize and accept multiple commands from the user we will build a Command class. The Command class is designed to be used as an interface. It will also interface with other classes, namely a Parse class, to differentiate multiple arguments and evaluate them properly. The Command class will be built with a Strategy pattern in mind, that is, we will utilize a common interface.
