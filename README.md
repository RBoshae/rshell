# rshell
CS100 Project, Assignment 3

Introduction: 
In this assignment we will emulate a shell terminal and call it rshell. When rshell is executed it will accept arguments from the user and execute the argumentâ€™s command(s). In order organize and accept multiple commands from the user we will build a Command class. The Command class is designed to be used as an interface. It will also interface with other classes, namely a Parse class, to differentiate multiple arguments and evaluate them properly. The Command class will be built with a Strategy pattern in mind, that is, we will utilize a common interface.

New Implementation:
Users can now utilize the test expression which will print a true or false value. Users can now use parentheses for precedence.

Bug Report:

Resolved Bugs:
	And class:
	execution returns an int to verify if we should run next child. If we have time we may want write a status function to do the same thing.
	With quotation marks the 
	no white space after the semi collen infinite loop initiated.
	if || with exit. Like ( echo goodbye || exit) exit should not terminate.
	Trailing semicolon will break the code.
	exits after first case was an unknown command.
	Precedence (echo a && (echo b || (echo c && echo d))) = unknown command
